Current music streaming platforms often fall short in delivering truly personalized
 recommendations, relying on algorithms that may not adequately capture
 individual preferences. 
This results in a less engaging and tailored music discovery experience, limiting
 the potential for users to explore new and exciting songs that align with their
 unique tastes.
 To address this problem, our project aims to develop a web-based platform that utilizes 
a option-based interface, allowing users to indicate their musical preferences by 
swiping right for liked songs and left for disliked ones. 
The platform will not only recommend songs based on these preferences but also actively
 seek and incorporate user feedback, enhancing the overall user experience and 
providing a more tailored music recommendation service.
